# Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Computing with PyMC

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2024/main)

Bayesian statistical methods offer a powerful set of tools to tackle a wide variety of data science problems. In addition, the Bayesian approach generates results that are easy to interpret and automatically account for uncertainty in quantities that we wish to estimate or predict. Historically, computational challenges have been a barrier, particularly to new users, but there now exists a mature set of probabilistic programming tools that are both capable and easy to learn. We will use the newest release of PyMC (version 5), but the concepts and approaches that will be taught are portable to any probabilistic programming framework.

This course is intended for practicing and aspiring data scientists and analysts looking to learn how to apply Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming to their work. It will provide learners with a high-level understanding of Bayesian statistical methods and their potential for use in a variety of applications. They will also gain hands-on experience with applying these methods using PyMC, specifically including the specification, fitting and checking of models applied to a couple of real-world datasets.

This is an introductory course, therefore no direct experience with PyMC or Bayesian statistics will be expected. However, to benefit maximally from the course, learners should have some familiarity with basic statistical modeling (things like regression and estimation) and with core components of the scientific Python stack (e.g. NumPy, pandas and Jupyter).

## Setup

This course can be set up using either Anaconda/Miniforge or Pixi for Python package management.

### Option 1: Using Anaconda/Miniforge

If you prefer using Anaconda, you'll need [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#download-section) Python (with Python version 3.11) installed on your system. We recommend using the [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download) distribution, which is a lightweight version of Anaconda that is easier to work with.

### Option 2: Using Pixi 

Alternatively, you can use Pixi, a modern package management tool. To install Pixi:

On Linux/macOS:
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash

On Windows:
    iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex

You may need to restart your terminal after installation.

### Getting the Course Materials

The next step is to clone or download the course materials. If you are familiar with Git, run:

    git clone https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2024.git

otherwise you can [download a zip file](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2023/archive/main.zip) of its contents, and unzip it on your computer.

### Setting up the Environment

If using Anaconda/Miniforge:
The repository contains an `environment.yml` file with all required packages. Run:

    mamba env create

from the main course directory (use `conda` instead of `mamba` if you installed Anaconda). Then activate the environment:

    mamba activate bayes_course
    # or
    conda activate bayes_course

If using Pixi:
The repository contains a `pixi.toml` file. From the main course directory, simply run:

    pixi install
    pixi shell

Then, you can start **JupyterLab** to access the materials:

    jupyter lab

The binder link above should also provide a working environment.

For those who like to work in VS Code, you can also run Jupyter notebooks from within VS Code. To do this, you will need to install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). Once this is installed, you can open the notebooks in the `notebooks` subdirectory and run them interactively.

## Pre-course Work

In advance of the course, we would like attendees to complete a short homework notebook that will ensure everyone has the requisite baseline knowledge. You can find this Jupyter notebook in the `/notebooks` subdirectory (under `Section0-Pre_Work.ipynb`). There is no need to hand this in to anyone, but please reach out if you have difficulty with any of the problems (or with setting up your computing environment) by creating an [issue](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/bayes_course_dec_2024/issues) in this repository, or by emailing.
