    "1. Our goal is to model and ultimately predict sales of each item in each store. Look at the `sales` column of our dataframe. Which likelihood distribution do you think you can use? [Easy]\n",
    "2. Once you have your likelihood, write a first simple model that doesn't differentiate between items not stores. It should be of the form `baseline + trend * time`. Don't forget to do some prior / posterior predictive checks before / after sampling. [Easy]\n",
    "3. Write down a second model, very similar your first one, but this time differentiating between items and stores. Again, use prior and posterior predictive checks to give you hints as whether your model goes in the right direction. [Easy]\n",
    "4. What do you think is missing from this model? [Easy]\n",
    "5. Add seasonality to your previous model. For simplicty, only differentiate the baseline by store and item, and leave the trend and seasonality component common to all stores and items. _Hint: refer to the lesson about time series modeling if you don't remember how to add seasonality_. [Medium]\n",
    "6. Forecast new sales for each store and item over the following year after the end of the training dataset. _Hint: use `pd.date_range(\"2018-01\", \"2019-01\", freq=\"M\")` to define the new dates_. [Medium]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inventory optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write a loss function that, depending on the demand forecast, inventory, sales price and holding cost, returns the loss you expect to see. _Hint: go back to the Bayesian decision making lesson if you don't remember how to setup such a loss function_. [Medium]\n",
    "8. As we did in the Bayesian decision making lesson, write an objective function to find the optimum inventory that each store should held for each item over the forecasted period, in order to minimize the expected loss. Use the `items_prices_costs.csv` file to get each item's sales price and holding cost. [Hard]\n",
    "9. Do the same thing, but this time adding the constraint that each store can't store more items that what's indicated in `stores_storage_limits.csv`. [Hard]"
